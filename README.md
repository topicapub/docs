# Topica Information System

Topica is an open system for distributed access and publication of
textual information. Topica consists of many components, interfaces and
data formats intended to be used together to create a powerful system
for managing information. At its core, Topica is a set of open interfaces
and formats. The Topica project also contains various components that
utilize these interfaces, but the intention is that any of these components
can be replaced with a custom implementation if desired, as long as the
implementation complies with the Topica interfaces and formats.
