# Topica Network Node

[Code Repository](https://github.com/topicapub/topica-node)

The Topica network is a distributed system made up of independent nodes.
Topica nodes serve as storage for the network, and communicate using the
Topica protocols. Topica nodes are networked in such a way that information
stored in any participating node can be accessed from any node in the
network. Information can also be replicated across multiple nodes in the
network, and cryptographically verified to be correct when accessed, thus
providing built in support for caching and scalability as a fundamental
property of the network.

For an overview of how data is accessed in the network, see
[Content References](./content-references.md). For more information on how
data is stored in an individual node, see [Topica Database](./database.md).
